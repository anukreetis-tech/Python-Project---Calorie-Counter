Project Statement: Calorie Counter

Problem Statement

Health and fitness applications frequently lack comprehensive or culturally-relevant data for regional cuisines, making accurate calorie tracking difficult for users consuming North Indian food. The objective is to provide a simple, localized command-line solution that enables goal-based tracking against a specific, manually curated database of popular North Indian dishes.

Scope of the Project:

The project scope is focused on the core logic of calorie tracking.

Fixed Data Model: Uses an in-memory Python dictionary containing estimated calorie values for a set of popular North Indian dishes.

Session-Based Tracking: The application tracks consumed calories only for the duration of the current session; no data persistence (saving/loading logs) is implemented in this version.

Core Functionality: Includes setting a goal, logging known foods, and displaying real-time calorie status.

Target Users:

The primary target users are:

Students/Beginners learning Python who need a simple project to understand data structures and functional programming.

Health Enthusiasts who consume North Indian cuisine and require a quick, zero-setup tool for estimating daily calorie intake.

High-Level Features:

Set a personalized daily calorie target.

Log consumption from a predefined North Indian food menu.

Receive instant feedback on consumed and remaining calories.

Graceful handling of incorrect or unknown food entries.
